CUI is home to students from all over the world; with its great academic programs, supportive faculty, staff and social environment. CUI has given me confidence and taught me to never stop yearning for knowledge. I have become an independent individual and am equipped with skills necessary to be positive and confident to face the social world ahead of me. Thanks CUI and Thanks Pakistan.

Sudanese Alumnus -
Abuelgasim Ibrahim Idriss Musa




Unlike the image portrayed abroad, Pakistan is a very safe place to live and study. Pakistanis love foreigners and have always made me feel at home. I would definitely recommend CUI to other prospective students.

Palestinian Alumnus -
Essa M. I. Elhamalawia




I was in search of a scholarship to fund my education and was privileged to receive the very competitive Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) scholarship to study at CUI. This opportunity to studying molecular biology has given me the rare chance of contributing towards research on diseases that will hopefully help improve lives.

Jordanian Alumna -
Haneen Anwar




My experience can simply be described as amazing and fulfilling. Studying in such a serene and comfortable environment under the tutelage of professors greatly helped my academic pursuit. Hence, I look forward to a future academic engagement with CUI again.

CUI is home to students from all over the world; with its great academic programs, supportive faculty, staff and social environment. CUI has given me confidence and taught me to never stop yearning for knowledge. I have become an independent individual and am equipped with skills necessary to be positive and confident to face the social world ahead of me. Thanks CUI and Thanks Pakistan.

Sudanese Alumnus -
Abuelgasim Ibrahim Idriss Musa




Unlike the image portrayed abroad, Pakistan is a very safe place to live and study. Pakistanis love foreigners and have always made me feel at home. I would definitely recommend CUI to other prospective students.

Palestinian Alumnus -
Essa M. I. Elhamalawia




I was in search of a scholarship to fund my education and was privileged to receive the very competitive Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) scholarship to study at CUI. This opportunity to studying molecular biology has given me the rare chance of contributing towards research on diseases that will hopefully help improve lives.

Jordanian Alumna -
Haneen Anwar




My experience can simply be described as amazing and fulfilling. Studying in such a serene and comfortable environment under the tutelage of professors greatly helped my academic pursuit. Hence, I look forward to a future academic engagement with CUI again.

CUI is home to students from all over the world; with its great academic programs, supportive faculty, staff and social environment. CUI has given me confidence and taught me to never stop yearning for knowledge. I have become an independent individual and am equipped with skills necessary to be positive and confident to face the social world ahead of me. Thanks CUI and Thanks Pakistan.

Sudanese Alumnus -
Abuelgasim Ibrahim Idriss Musa




Unlike the image portrayed abroad, Pakistan is a very safe place to live and study. Pakistanis love foreigners and have always made me feel at home. I would definitely recommend CUI to other prospective students.

Palestinian Alumnus -
Essa M. I. Elhamalawia




I was in search of a scholarship to fund my education and was privileged to receive the very competitive Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) scholarship to study at CUI. This opportunity to studying molecular biology has given me the rare chance of contributing towards research on diseases that will hopefully help improve lives.

Jordanian Alumna -
Haneen Anwar




My experience can simply be described as amazing and fulfilling. Studying in such a serene and comfortable environment under the tutelage of professors greatly helped my academic pursuit. Hence, I look forward to a future academic engagement with CUI again.

CUI is home to students from all over the world; with its great academic programs, supportive faculty, staff and social environment. CUI has given me confidence and taught me to never stop yearning for knowledge. I have become an independent individual and am equipped with skills necessary to be positive and confident to face the social world ahead of me. Thanks CUI and Thanks Pakistan.

Sudanese Alumnus -
Abuelgasim Ibrahim Idriss Musa




Unlike the image portrayed abroad, Pakistan is a very safe place to live and study. Pakistanis love foreigners and have always made me feel at home. I would definitely recommend CUI to other prospective students.

Palestinian Alumnus -
Essa M. I. Elhamalawia




I was in search of a scholarship to fund my education and was privileged to receive the very competitive Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) scholarship to study at CUI. This opportunity to studying molecular biology has given me the rare chance of contributing towards research on diseases that will hopefully help improve lives.

Jordanian Alumna -
Haneen Anwar




My experience can simply be described as amazing and fulfilling. Studying in such a serene and comfortable environment under the tutelage of professors greatly helped my academic pursuit. Hence, I look forward to a future academic engagement with CUI again.
