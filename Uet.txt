Enhancing  students enrollment to 19500 by 2020 and to 22340 by 2030

ii.         Faculty  Expansion and Development

It  is planned to expand faculty 1083 by 2020 & 1241 by 2030 
It  is planned to have 70% Ph.D. teachers by 2020 & 100% Ph.D. faculty by 2030  in various Campuses.

In  order to lay requisite emphasis on research, Undergraduate student’s enrolment  shall be maintained around 6000 students. 
Efforts  to transform main Campus into a world class institution shall continue through  further strengthening of departments, research centers and formation of  research culture. To this end unutilized amount of allocated funds for  strengthening of this campus will be spent on improvement of infrastructure,  research facilities and faculty development. 
Postgraduate  enrolment shall be gradually enhanced to 4000 students.  
The  campus shall have 70% by 2020, 80% by 2025 and 100% PhDs by 2030.

iv.      Internationalization  of UET
          Following  Measures are envisaged in this regard: -
  *          Split  Ph.D. programmes with foreign institutes shall be promoted.
  *          Induction  of overseas students will be enhanced 1000 students and better   hostel facilities will be provided to them.
  *          International  collaboration by various departments and research centres     shall be expanded on similar lines as by  Alkhawarzimi Institute of      Computer  science with MIT, Harvard, SISCO, Cavium etc.

vi.      Ensuring  Financial Sustainability
            Over the last two years it has been experienced that the  government/HEC is finding it difficult to honour its commitment of Grant in Aid  and PSDP allocation to the universities. It has therefore, become imperative to  enhance university’s income from own resources. To this end following measures  are proposed to be initiated: -

Merit  based fee structure with deferred payment facility for needy students will be  introduced (subject to approval of the Government of Punjab) to make up for the  financial squeeze applied by HEC/ Government.

 

Various  departments shall generate additional funds through Short Courses. Professional  Development Programmes and Evening Teaching 


“Engineering  Services UET Pvt. Ltd” – a recently established company, shall be expanded to  full scale consultancy, design and project handling services to generate funds. 

 


UET  has a fairly large and well placed alumni. This source will be fully tapped to  beef up university’s endowment fund.
